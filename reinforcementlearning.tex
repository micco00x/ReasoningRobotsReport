\section{Reinforcement Learning}
Reinforcement learning \cite{Suttonrl18} is an area of machine learning
which aims at studying how to to develop agents that can interact with
their environment maximing a cumulative reward. The environment can be
formally defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is a tuple
$\langle S, A, \delta, R \rangle$ where $S$ is a finite state of states that can represent
the environment, $A$ is a finite state of actions that can be perform by
the agent in the environment, $\delta$ is a probability function modeling
the transition from a state to another when performing a certain action and
$R$ is a reward function which models the reward received by the environment
when performing a certain action which makes the agent move from a state
to another.

An interesting property of the MDP is that it satisfies the Markov property,
hence, the future states that will be reached by the agent do not depend
on the past interaction of the environment, but just on the current state.
This makes it possbile to define the transition and the reward function
depending only on the current state (and of course the action and the future
state of interest).

This section considers two common reinforcement learning algorithm,
namely Q-Learning and SARSA, which have been used in our experiments
in order to train an agent interacting with an Atari Breakout environment
(section \ref{subsec:experiments}).

Q-Learning algorithm.
\begin{equation}
    Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \alpha \Big[ R_{t+1} +
        \gamma \max_{a} Q(S_{t+1}, A_t) - Q(S_t, A_t) \Big]
\end{equation}
